# ITECH3201_Assignment2

## TODO:
### Non-Code
- Design map with Locations that will be used in the game.
- Create youtube video post creation explaining the application and development methodology.
- Report following completion of the program documenting work performed, user stories, etc.

### Code
- Implement CommandHandler
- Implement Commands that will be handled (fly, flights, look, talk)
- Add logic to NPC class for clues?
- Refactor smelly classes and methods


### Discussion
- System implementation and design, there are a few ways to go about this of various difficulties
- We're using an "agile" method where features are rapidly implemented and assessed
- Patterns (State) 
- Ideas
- How to implement NPCs with clues (I have a few thoughts on this however none I'm too sure of rn)
- Releases (We're only required to allow for one case to be played however implementing a multiple case game shouldn't be too hard)
